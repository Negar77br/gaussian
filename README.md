# gaussian
My attempt at making a semi comprehensive guide on running Gaussian calculations on MacOS.

This is a repository for all the files you need to run gaussian calculations on the Princeton Research Compting cluster (for more info visit: https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/gaussian).

After you have acquired permission to use the cluster (see the link above for receiving access), you can access the cluster using the MacOS terminal with the command: 

`ssh <YourNetID>@adroit.princeton.edu #you need VPN for off-campus access`

You will be then prompted to log in using your NetID password and DUO authentication.
